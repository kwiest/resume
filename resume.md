## Background

I am a software developer, the Director of Football Operations at the
University of Oregon, a certified high school math teacher, and a life-long
learner.

I am very proud to have played a role in helping the Oregon Ducks win 3
outright conference championships, and be the only team in the nation to play in
4 consecutive BCS Bowl Games, including the National Championship game in 2011.

I have been fortunate enough to work under the 2 most decorated coaches in Oregon
history, including one who is rightfully credited with revolutionizing the game.

3 years ago, while working for various football camps I saw the need for simple
online registration and camp mangement software and started [Camp Registration
Systems, LLC](https://campregistrationsystems.com). Camp Registration Systems
is now responsible for all camps at the University of Oregon as well as the
[Manning Passing Academy](http://manningpassingacademy.com) and has processed
over $3,600,000 in online transactions.

Since starting work with Ruby and Rails a little over 3 years ago, I have become
increasingly interested in programming, and open source software. I hope that I
have more time in the future to contribute my own code to open source projects.

I love sports and have been involved with them in one form or another for most
of my life. From 1999-2002 I was an 8th grade basketball coach and started a
basketball team at Churchill Alternative High School while teaching there in
2006. I also coached Junior Varsity football at Sheldon high school during
1999-2000.

I was a Dean's Scholarship recipient at the University of Oregon, and in my free
time I enjoy cycling, reading, and going to the movies.
